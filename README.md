# Esoterica

> (n.) esoteric or highly specialized subjects or publications.

Or a simple CMS that I created with SvelteJS and Sqlite.

## Getting Started

- Run `db/create_table.sql` to create the necessary tables within a Sqlite `.db` file
- Copy `.sample.env` to `.env`
- Change the content within `.env`:
  - `DB_FILE`: where the Sqlite file is located
  - `ADMIN_AUTH`: a pair of `username:password` to access the admin page
- Make sure that `yarn` is ready
- Install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

- Start developing

```shell
yarn dev
```
